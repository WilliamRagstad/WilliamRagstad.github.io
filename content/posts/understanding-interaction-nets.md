This article is part of a series on understanding mathematical concepts.
In this post, we will explore the concept of interaction nets.
I've long been fascinated by the subject and applications in computer science and mathematics.

## Introduction

Interaction nets are a formalism for graph rewriting systems that can be used to model computation.
They are a generalization of lambda calculus and combinatory logic, and can be used to represent various computational models.
Interaction nets are used to describe the interaction between nodes in a graph, where nodes represent terms and edges represent interactions between terms.
The nodes in the graph can be rewritten according to a set of rules, which allows for the computation to proceed.

Interaction nets have been used to model various computational systems, such as lambda calculus, combinatory logic, and term rewriting systems.
They have also been used to model the interaction between agents in distributed systems, and to study the properties of concurrent computation.

In this article, we will explore the basic concepts of interaction nets, their relation to lambda calculus and combinatory logic, and their applications in computer science and mathematics.
