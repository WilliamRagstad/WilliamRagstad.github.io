## Hello friend ðŸ‘‹

### What is this place?

This is ***my corner of the internet&trade;*** where I write about *stuff I find interesting*.
One could say this is a *digital archive* of my thoughts and ideas.
Some kind of **long-term memory storage** for my brain *if you will*.\
Of course I also try to do my best making it somewhat comprehensible for anyone who might stumble upon it *as well*, to the best of my ability.

Please, stay a while and maybe *[find something that interests you](/posts/)* too ðŸŒŸ

### Who am I?

I'm William, **self-proclaimed nerd** and polyglot programmer.
I have a **deep passion for technology, innovation and learning**, mostly thanks to my **curiosity** and desire to understand *how things work in all its complexity*.
I think this is why I've always been drawn to *computers* and *programming*, but also *mathematics* and *science* in later years.
I'm a *creative* and *analytical* person who loves to explore new ideas and concepts.
I've studied **Computer Science** at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) and are currently working as a **Software Engineer consultant** at [Willsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/company/willsoft-it).

I'm *especially* interested in:
