This article is part of a series on understanding different concepts in computer science and software engineering.
In this post, we will explore the concept of abstract interpretation.
The reason I started investigating this topic is because I watched a talk by **Patrick Cousot** on [Abstract Interpretation: A Unified Lattice Model for Static Analysis of Programs by Construction or Approximation of Fixpoints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBlfJerAcRw), where he mentioned that *"abstract interpretation is a theory of sound approximation of the semantics of programs by abstract domains"*.
