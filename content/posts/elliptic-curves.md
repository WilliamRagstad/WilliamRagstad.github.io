This article is part of a series on understanding different concepts in computer science, mathematics, and cryptography.
In this post, we will explore the concept of elliptic curve cryptography.
The reason I started investigating this topic is because I read a paper by **Neal Koblitz** on [Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-39799-X_31), where he mentioned that *"elliptic curves provide a new approach to public key cryptography"*.
