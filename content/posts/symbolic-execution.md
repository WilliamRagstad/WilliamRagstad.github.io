This article is part of a series on understanding different concepts in computer science and software engineering.
In this post, we will explore the concept of symbolic execution.
The reason I started investigating this topic is because I watched a talk by **Cristian Cadar** on [Symbolic Execution for Software Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXk8rDEwhBo), where he mentioned that *"symbolic execution is a powerful technique for automatically exploring the behaviors of programs"*.
