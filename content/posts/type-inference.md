This article is part of a series on understanding different concepts in computer science and programming.
In this post, we will explore the concept of type inference.
The reason I started investigating this topic is because I read a paper by **Robin Milner** on [A Theory of Type Polymorphism in Programming](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Milner78.pdf), where he mentioned that *"type inference is the process of automatically deducing the types of expressions in a program"*.
