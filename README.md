# My personal website
This is my personal website. It is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and my fork of the [Blowfish](https://github.com/WilliamRagstad/blowfish) theme.
Here I will post about my projects and other things I find interesting among other things such as:
- Personal blog
- Project portfolio and showcase
- About me
- Resume (CV)
- Links to my social media
